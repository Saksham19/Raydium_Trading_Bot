**Raydium Trading Bot**

**Instructions**

1. Create a .env file in the source folder and add the folllowing:
   <br />PRIVATE_KEY = '' ##wallet private key
  <br /> tele_bot_token = ''  #this is from the telegram bot you would create
  <br /> tele_bot_chat_id = ''  #the @ of the group which the tele bot is part of

3. Run the bot and watch your networth get burnt up on shitcoins

Can change the settings of types of pools to look for within the 'raydium_degen_bot.py'

The bot is still a work in progess. Things to do:
1. Make the bot more stable when running continous trades
2. Add in the ability to load in raydium pool data without pulling it off the API (cause its too slow for degen trades)
